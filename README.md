## My process

- Start with identifying the biggest parts that make up the website. In this case, the website is comprised of a section containing a qr image and some text within that is centered right at the middles. An additional div was added in the starting html containing attributions.

-Create a div to be centered in the middle of the website. Further divide it into two divisions: one for the qr image and the text. Additionally, i turned the attributions div to a footer and have it styled to stick at the bottom of the page with the text centered.

-Add the images and the text within their dedicated divs.

-Based on the text it can be further divided into two parts with. The first sentence is set to h3 whereas the second sentence is enclosed in a p tag. This way the first sentence has a larger font size than the second sentence.

-Style the website and estimate the measurements through trial and error until the website closely resembles the example image.

### Built with

--HTML5
--Vanilla CSS
--VSCode

### Continued development

My goal is to do these front end challenges every now and then to further polish my CSS knowledge and develop my own "library of patterns" containing layout patterns and formatting patterns that I can refer to and use on my own projects in the future.
